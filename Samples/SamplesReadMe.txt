The samples in this folder and its subfolders are released under the creative commons license (see http://creativecommons.org/by/3.0/). They were created or collected (and possibly modified) by Robin Schmidt (www.rs-met.com). Those of them, which were not originally created by Robin Schmidt, were previously released by other authors under creative commons license. In each subfolder, you will find a LicensingAndCredits.txt file which attributes the original authors (and repeats parts of this text).

-Sin: sinusoidal part of the sound (harmonic and inharmonic partials)
-Noi: noisy part of the sound
-Tra: attack transient
-Inh: inharmonic partials
-Har: harmonic partials
-Eve: even harmonic partials

-Cyc: single cycle from the signal
